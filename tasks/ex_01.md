# Task Description 1

In this exercise, you will implement functions to load, preprocess, and prepare time-series welding data for machine learning analysis. You'll build the foundation for the entire project by creating data handling functions that will be used in subsequent exercises.

## Objectives:
1. Implement functions to load welding data from CSV files
2. Apply data preprocessing steps for time-series data
3. Create functions to convert and structure data for machine learning applications
4. Implement sliding window techniques for sequence data

## Tasks:

### Exercise 1.1: Data Loading Function
   - Implement the `load_data(data_path: Path)` function that:
     - Reads data from a CSV file
     - Removes unlabeled data (call auxiliary function from 2.1)
     - Handles missing values by dropping them
     - Raises FileNotFoundError if the specified data file does not exist
     - Returns a preprocessed DataFrame

### Exercise 1.2: Auxiliary Functions
   - Create a `remove_unlabeled_data(data: pd.DataFrame)` function to filter out rows with unlabeled data
   - This function should return only rows where the 'labels' column value is not -1

### Exercise 1.3: Data Conversion Function
   - Implement the `convert_to_np(data: pd.DataFrame)` function that:
     - Separates labels and experiment IDs from feature columns
     - Extracts current and voltage measurements (columns starting with "I" and "V") and convert to numpy arrays
     - Restructures data into a 3D array with shape [n_samples, timesteps, 2]
       where the last dimension contains current and voltage data
     - Returns a tuple containing (labels, exp_ids, data)

### Exercise 1.4: Sequence Generation Function
   - Implement the `create_sliding_windows_first_dim(data: np.ndarray, sequence_length: int)` function that:
     - Creates sliding windows over the first dimension of a 3D array
     - Uses numpy's sliding_window_view function
     - Transforms data into sequences of specified length
     - Applies proper reshaping and transposing operations to get the correct output shape
     - Returns a windowed array with proper dimensions

### Exercise 1.5: Complete Data Pipeline Function
   - Implement the `get_welding_data(path: Path, n_samples: int | None = None, return_sequences: bool = False, sequence_length: int = 100)` function that:
     - Checks if numpy cache files already exist in the same directory as the input file
     - If cache does not exist: loads and processes data, then saves to .npy files
     - If cache exists: loads directly from .npy files
     - Optionally creates sequence data using sliding windows if return_sequences=True
     - Samples n_samples random samples if specified (handles edge cases appropriately)
     - Returns a tuple of (data, labels, exp_ids)

### Exercise 1.6: Error Handling
   - Ensure your functions properly handle:
     - Missing files
     - Empty dataframes
     - NaN values in the data
     - Cases where all data is unlabeled

## Testing Your Implementation

A comprehensive test suite (`test_ex_01_read_data.py`) has been provided to validate your implementation. All tests should pass when your code is correctly implemented. The tests check:

- Basic functionality of all functions
- Proper error handling
- Data shape and structure preservation
- Sequence windowing behavior
- Data sampling functionality
- Edge cases and error conditions

To run the tests, use:
```bash
pytest tests/test_ex_01_read_data.py -v
```

## Expected Outcomes:
- A fully functional data loading and preprocessing module
- Proper handling of real-world data issues (missing values, incorrect types)
- Ability to transform raw welding data into formats suitable for machine learning
- Functions that handle both individual samples and sequence data

## Notes:
- Download the data from the Zenodo repository mentioned in the README
- Pay attention to the data shape transformations, especially when creating sliding windows
- Implement caching to numpy files for faster loading in subsequent runs
- Study the test cases carefully to understand the expected behavior of your functions

This exercise builds the foundation for feature extraction, clustering, and classification tasks that will follow in later exercises.
