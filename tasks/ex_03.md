# Task Description 3

In this exercise, you will implement feature extraction techniques for time-series welding data and create visualizations to analyze these features. You'll extract statistical and frequency-domain features from the welding signals and create plots to explore relationships between these features.

## Objectives:
1. Implement functions to extract meaningful features from time-series welding data
2. Calculate statistical measures from voltage and current signals
3. Extract frequency-domain features using spectral analysis
4. Visualize feature relationships to gain insights for classification tasks
5. Document your feature selection strategy

## Tasks:

### Exercise 3.1: Dominant Frequency Extraction Function
   - Implement the `find_dominant_frequencies(x: np.ndarray, fs: int)` function in `ex_03_feature_extraction.py` that:
     - Takes multiple input signals and a sampling frequency
     - Applies detrending and windowing to prepare signals for frequency analysis
     - Computes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals to frequency domain
     - Calculates Power Spectral Density (PSD)
     - Identifies and returns the dominant frequency for each signal

### Exercise 3.2: Feature Extraction Function
   - Implement the `extract_features(data: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray)` in `ex_03_feature_extraction.py` function that:
     - Extracts 20 different features from the raw voltage and current signals. These sould include the following:
       - Statistical features (e.g. mean, std, median, min, max) for voltage and current
       - Frequency features based on the FFT of the voltage and current signals
       - Power-related features (e.g. voltage * current)
     - Returns a DataFrame with all features and quality labels

#### Note:
- You can use the following links to find more information about the features:
   - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform
   - https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html

### Exercise 3.3: Feature Visualization
   - Create a seaborn pairplot to visualize relationships between extracted features in `ex_03_feature_plots.ipynb`
   - Use color coding to distinguish between different quality classes
   - Save the visualization for further analysis and reporting

### Exercise 3.4: Feature Selection Documentation
   - Document your feature selection approach in `ex_03_feature_plots.ipynb`
   - Explain the rationale behind chosen features
   - Analyze which features appear most discriminative for quality classification

## Expected Outcomes:
- A comprehensive feature extraction module for welding data analysis
- A set of 20 meaningful features extracted from raw voltage and current signals
- Visualizations showing relationships between extracted features
- Documentation of feature selection strategy

## Testing Your Implementation
To run the tests, use:
```bash
pytest tests/test_ex_03_feature_extraction.py -v
```

## Notes:
- Use the `get_welding_data()` function from Exercise 1 to load the raw data
- Consider both time-domain and frequency-domain features for a complete analysis
- Pay attention to proper signal preprocessing before frequency analysis
- Document why certain features might be more valuable than others for classification
- Consider computational efficiency when implementing feature extraction
- Ensure all features are scaled appropriately for visualization

This exercise builds on the data loading foundations established in Exercise 1 and prepares you for classification and clustering tasks that will follow in subsequent exercises.
