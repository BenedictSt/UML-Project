# Task Description 2

In this exercise, you will implement visualization and statistical analysis functions to explore the time-series welding data loaded in the previous exercise. You'll create various plots and data summaries that will help you understand the characteristics of the welding dataset and provide insights for subsequent machine learning tasks.

## Objectives:
1. Calculate and present descriptive statistics for the welding dataset
2. Visualize current and voltage distributions using boxplots
3. Create interactive time-series plots of welding cycles
4. Generate and compare multiple random sample visualizations

## Tasks:

### Exercise 2.1: Dataset Statistics Analysis

In this exercise, we'll calculate and present comprehensive descriptive statistics for the welding dataset. This statistical overview will help us understand the fundamental characteristics of our data before visualization or modeling.

1. Calculate the class distribution to understand data balance
2. Count samples per experiment to assess data volume across experimental conditions
3. Determine min/max values for voltage and current to understand the range of measurements
4. Calculate mean and standard deviation to assess central tendency and variability
5. Find median values to identify central points unaffected by outliers


### Exercise 2.2: Current and Voltage Distribution Visualization

In this exercise, we'll create interactive boxplots to visualize and compare the distributions of voltage and current measurements in the welding data. Boxplots will help us identify central tendencies, spread, and potential outliers in our measurements.

1. Create side-by-side boxplots for voltage and current using Plotly
2. Display key statistics (median, quartiles, etc.) in a visual format in the plot
3. Enable interactive exploration of the distributions
4. Save the visualization for future reference


### Exercise 2.3: Time-Series Sequence Visualization

In this exercise, we'll implement functions to visualize the time-series patterns of welding cycles. These visualizations will help us understand the temporal relationships between voltage and current during the welding process and identify patterns associated with quality outcomes.

1. Create dual-axis plots showing voltage and current over time
2. Implement clear legends and labels for data interpretation
3. Enable saving of visualizations for reporting and comparison


### Exercise 2.4: Interactive Time-Series Visualization with Plotly

In this exercise, we'll create enhanced interactive visualizations of welding samples using Plotly. These interactive plots will provide more advanced exploration capabilities for analyzing the time-series patterns.

1. Create interactive plots with dual y-axes for voltage and current
2. Implement time-based range sliders for detailed exploration
3. Add unified tooltips for precise data reading
4. Display quality metrics in the plot title
5. Save interactive visualizations as HTML for sharing


### Exercise 2.5: Multiple Sample Comparison

In this exercise, we'll generate and compare visualizations from multiple random welding samples. This comparison will help us identify common patterns and variations across different welding cycles.

1. Generate multiple random sample visualizations
2. Create dual-axis plots showing voltage and current over time
3. Implement clear legends and labels for data interpretation
4. Save each visualization for comparison


## Expected Outcomes:
- A comprehensive statistical overview of the welding dataset
- Interactive and static visualizations of data distributions
- Time-series plots showing voltage and current patterns
- Ability to visually compare multiple welding samples
- Saved visualization outputs for use in reports or presentations

## Notes:
- Use the `get_welding_data()` function from Exercise 1 to load the data
- Pay attention to proper figure sizing and layout for readability
- Include appropriate labels, titles, and legends in all visualizations
- When creating interactive plots, consider adding features that aid in data exploration
- Save all generated plots to the specified output directory for future reference
- Consider performance implications when working with large datasets

This exercise builds on the data loading foundations established in Exercise 1 and will help you gain insights into the welding data characteristics before proceeding to more advanced analysis and modeling.
